# Xentropy

As it relates to machine learning, entropy is a measure of impurity. Entropy is the expected number of guesses required to arrive at the correct outcome under the optimal strategy for the model. The more uncertain the strategy, the higher the entropy.

Cross entropy for a given strategy is the expected number of questions to guess the correct outcome under that strategy. For a given setup, the better the strategy is, the lower the cross entropy is.
